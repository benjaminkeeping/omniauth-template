## Rails project with omniauth

Basic rails 3 project with omniauth, jquery, rspec and cucumber more or less set up.

You must have a root route set up, and see initializers/omniauth.rb for what environment settings are needed or to change what login providers are available.

Fiddling this to match your expected use is *expected* ;)
